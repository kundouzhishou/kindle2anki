Each individual builds "extensive knowledge structures" that connect new ideas to what is known so that knowledge is always personal and somewhat idiosyncratic.

Critical thinking is the use of those cognitive skills or strategies that increase the probability of a desirable outcome. It is used to describe thinking that is purposeful, reasoned, and goal directedâ€”the kind of thinking involved in solving problems, formulating inferences, calculating likelihoods, and making decisions, when the thinker is using skills that are thoughtful and eff ective for the particular context and type of thinking task.		362	Added on Wednesday, March 16, 2016 8:37:11 AM
